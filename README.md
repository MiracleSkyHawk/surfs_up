## Overview of the Analysis:

The goal of this analysis is to help W. Avy to extract the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

1. From the mean values, we can see that the temperature of June is almost 4 degrees higher than the temperature of December. Therefore, June is generally warmer.
2. The temperature data in December has a larger standard deviation than the temperature data in June, which indicates that the temperature varies more in December.
3. Although the maximum temperatures in June and December are similar, the minimum temperature in June is much higher than that in December. Therefore, December in Oahu can be colder when the temperature drops.

## Summary

Overall, the temperature in December varies more and is slightly lower than the temperature in June. There are two queries that can be performed to gather more weather data:

- Group the temperature data by stations, latitude, longitude, and elevation to study the geographical difference
- Group the temperature data by year to study the change of temperature over time
